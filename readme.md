# Welcome to the Ultimate Video-to-Slide Conversion Machine!

Ever watched a video with great slides but wished you could just grab those frames and turn them into a PowerPoint? Well, look no further! This tool will do exactly that! We extract frames from your video, compare each one with the next, and only keep the ones that are different. The result? A seamless PowerPoint presentation built from your video content!

This was born during the times of endless Zoom classes when teachers decided to record their slides but not share them. Well, we've got your back!

## **Getting Started**

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TheRealMarVin/video_to_powerpoint.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:** We keep it simple and use Python (because Python makes everything better). Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Script:** Provide your video folder and customize your preferences:

   ```bash
   python main.py --video_folder videos --output_folder ./out --presentation_folder ./presentation --slide_layout 6 --output_name my_slides.pptx --start_time 10 --duration 10
   ```

   Replace `videos` with your folder containing video files, customize the `output_folder` for extracted frames, set your desired `presentation_folder`, select a `slide_layout`, specify an optional `output_name` for the PowerPoint presentation, and define the `--start_time` and `--duration` if needed.

4. **Admire Your Work:** Open the generated `.pptx` file in your `presentation_folder` and bask in your genius.
